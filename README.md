# Attributions / History

* Really we want to use Chrome / chromium / NW.JS and webRTC to capture all
  games, but there are some caveats, so we built this for now until webrtc game
  capture support is seamless and complete
* We started this code based on the Direct Show Desktop Capture Filter:
  https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free
* OBS https://obsproject.com is awesome at capturing the frames from a game,
  so we use that code for capturing frames from games
* All direct show filters make heavy use of the Micosoft DirectShow SDK
  BaseClasses
* We use the super fast g2log by Kjell Hedstroem for logging
* We use several of the chromium base classes / infrastructure
